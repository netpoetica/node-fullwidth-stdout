Format a string for stdout to be the full width of a terminal window

This little library is intended for use in a situation where, for example, you are using [chalk](https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk) with a background color to your text, and you want your background color to extend the entire width of your terminal.

I wrote this lib in answer to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26533620/javascript-escape-sequence-meaning-to-end-of-stdout-or-similar-usage) question on StackOverflow.
